# UXP Entry Points

Plugins can have multiple entry points. An entrypoint is a way for a plugin to be invoked.

There are two types of entry points: `commands` and `panels`. 

- Commands are _"run and forget"_ entry points that are invoked by the user, such as a menu item or a keyboard shortcut. 
- Panels have a panel that can be opened by the user from the UI. The user can then interact with the panel.

The main difference between the two is that panels can have a persistent UI. Commands are invoked and then disappear.

However, both commands and panels can show modal dialogs. Modal dialogs are a special type of UI that blocks the user from interacting with the rest of the application until the dialog is closed. They are useful for getting information from the user:
