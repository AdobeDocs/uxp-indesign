# FlattenerPreference
Transparency flattener preferences.

## Instance
> *Read Only* 
> 
> Boolean **isValid** 
>
> Returns true if the object specifier resolves to valid objects.
<HorizontalLine />
> *Read Only* 
> 
> Spread **parent** 
>
> The parent of the FlattenerPreference (a Spread).
<HorizontalLine />
> *Read Only* 
> 
> Events **events** 
>
> A collection of events.
<HorizontalLine />
> *Read Only* 
> 
> EventListeners **eventListeners** 
>
> A collection of event listeners.
<HorizontalLine />
> Mixed **rasterVectorBalance** 
>
> The amount of vector artwork to rasterize during flattening, specified as an enumerator or as a percentage in the range 0 to 100. Can return: FlattenerLevel enumerator or Real (0 - 100).
<HorizontalLine />
> Number **lineArtAndTextResolution** 
>
> The resolution for vector objects rasterized as a result of flattening. (Range: 1 to 9600) For information, see raster vector balance.
<HorizontalLine />
> Number **gradientAndMeshResolution** 
>
> The resolution for gradients rasterized as a result of flattening and for drop shadow and feathers when printed or exported. (Range: 0 to 1200) Note: Resolutions higher than 300 ppi increase file size and printing time but generally do not improve the image quality.
<HorizontalLine />
> Boolean **clipComplexRegions** 
>
> If true, ensures that the boundaries between vector and rasterized artwork fall along object paths.
<HorizontalLine />
> Boolean **convertAllStrokesToOutlines** 
>
> If true, converts all strokes to outlines and ensures that stroke widths remain constant during flattening. Note: Can cause thin strokes to appear slightly thicker than their original width. Affects all strokes, not only strokes involved in the transparency.
<HorizontalLine />
> Boolean **convertAllTextToOutlines** 
>
> If true, converts all text to outlines and discards all type glyph information on spreads with transparency; ensures that the width of text strokes remains constant during flattening. Note: Can cause small fonts to appear slightly thicker when viewed in Acrobat or printed on low-quality desktop printers, but does not affect type quality when printed on high-resolution printers or imagesetters.
<HorizontalLine />
> Object **properties** 
>
> A property that allows setting of several properties at the same time.

### Methods
> String **toSource**()
> 
> Generates a string which, if executed, will return the FlattenerPreference.
<HorizontalLine />
> FlattenerPreference **getElements**()
> 
> Resolves the object specifier, creating an array of object references.
<HorizontalLine />
> String **toSpecifier**()
> 
> Retrieves the object specifier.
<HorizontalLine />
> EventListener **addEventListener**( String **eventType**, Mixed **handler**, Boolean **captures** )
> 
> Adds an event listener.

<HorizontalLine />
> Boolean **removeEventListener**( String **eventType**, Mixed **handler**, Boolean **captures** )
> 
> Removes the event listener.
#### Parameters
