# Text-Editor Association for .idjs Files

This page goes over how to open your preferred text editor while creating InDesign scripts. 

When double-clicking an idjs (UXP Script) file for the first time, the user will see an alert asking them to associate UXP script files with a text-editor of their choice, so that subsequent double-clicks directly open scripting files in their preferred editor.

## Steps to achieve this on MacOS:

1. Right-click any .idjs-file
2. Click "Get Info"
3. Under "Open With",  select an editor of your choice from the application list 
4. If not visible in the list, click "Other" and select an editor from the "Applications" folder, and click "Add"
5. Click the button that says "Change All" and then "Continue".

## Adding a keyboard shortcut

A list of the scripts in your Scripts panel appears. Select a script and assign a keyboard shortcut as you would for any other InDesign feature.
