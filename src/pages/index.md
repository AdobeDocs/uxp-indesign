## Getting started
UXP allows you to accomplish tasks, and make changes to a document or its contents quickly.
Get started by [learning about UXP](./introduction/) and setting up your environment with [essential tools](./introduction/essentials/tech-stack/).

## Scripts and plugins
UXP offers you two ways of extending the application's capabilities - scripts and plugins. Begin by knowing the [difference between them](./introduction/next-steps/script-and-plugin/) and finding a suitable choice for your use case. Followed by, writing your very first [script](./scripts/) or [plugin](./plugins/).

## Resources and API references
Learn the [fundamental concepts](./resources/fundamentals/) needed to develop UXP scripts and plugins and find bite-size [recipes](./resources/recipes/) for common use cases.

Since UXP is still evolving, keep an eye out for the [latest APIs](./changelog/) in recent releases and their references in [UXP APIs](/indesign/uxp/reference/uxp-api/) and [InDesign APIs](/indesign/dom/api/).

Check out the [sample repository](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-indesign-samples) that has ready-made plugins and scripts to help you set up popular frameworks easily.

## Share & Distribute
Share your work with your family, friends and more users by distributing it via Adobe Marketplace. Learn more [here](./introduction/next-steps/distribution/).
