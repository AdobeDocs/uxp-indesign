# Starters and samples
To help you start writing scripts and plugins to solve real-world problems, you can use the samples and starter templates.

Consider 'samples' to be a working example of a specific feature. Whereas, a 'starter' is meant to assist you with the framework setup.

## Git repo
You can find samples and starters for scripts/plugins [here](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-indesign-samples). 

## UDT
Additionally, UDT also provides a few templates that you can choose from while creating a new plugin. <br></br>

## In-app helpers
InDesign has a bunch of sample UXP Scripts readily available within the app. Find them under Windows-> Utilities -> Scripts panel. <br></br>

## Recipes
The next section of [recipes](../recipes/) also has examples of common use cases. 


<br></br> <br></br>

Remember, that examples within scripts can also be used within plugins, and vice versa. After all, you can think of UXP plugins as UXP scripts + sophisticated UI controls + manifest configurations. 

We would love to add more samples that cover relevant use cases. Please contribute to the repo and share your work with the community. Create a pull request and tag us for review.
