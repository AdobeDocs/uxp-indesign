# Resources

By now, we hope that you have already tried a simple script or plugin by following the getting-started guides. 

The resources here are meant for you to deep dive into UXP and build something more useful for real-world scenarios. These topics are mostly common to both - scripts and plugins, with minor variations sometimes. 

Start by reading the [fundamentals](./fundamentals/), and move to the [recipes](./recipes/) that aim to provide bite-size examples for common use cases. And then, explore the APIs in the [References](/indesign/uxp/changelog/) section.
