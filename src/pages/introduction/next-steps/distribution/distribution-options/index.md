# Distribution Options

Once you have a packaged your code correctly, you're ready to distribute it.

## Distributing scripts
A UXP script can be directly shared. Just share your `.idjs` file with your family and friends and they can run it after importing it within the scripts panel.

## Distributing plugins

While sharing your plugins, you have a couple of options:

<SummaryBlock slots="heading, text, buttons" background="rgb(141, 52, 78)" />

### Distribute on Creative Cloud Plugin Marketplace

Use the Developer Distribution portal to submit your plugin to the Plugin Marketplace to reach a large number of users.
Users can download your plugin directly in the Creative Cloud desktop app.

### Direct distribution with `.ccx` files

Give the plugin to your family, friends, and workmates. You can email the `.ccx` file or, more likely, put it on a cloud folder somewhere for them to download. All they need to do is double-click the `.ccx` file to install using the Creative Cloud application. It's that easy! Be aware that distributing this way will require them to click through the "Do you trust this?" warning dialog boxes that appear after they double-click.
