## InDesign UXP scripting
There are a few things you can do in scripting that you cannot do using the user interface. UXP provides a comprehensive extensibility solution, turning modern JavaScript (ECMAScript 6) and HTML markup into controls in native application windows. UXP scripts run within the same process as the host application, with their UI in its own non-blocking thread. Scripts can create menus, add menu items, create and display dialog boxes and panels, and respond to user-interface selections. Scripts can read and write text files and parse XML data. 


## The power of UXP

UXP is the modern way to create scripts and plugins for Adobe Creative Cloud products. UXP provides a comprehensive extensibility solution, turning modern JavaScript (ECMAScript 6) and HTML markup into controls in native application windows. UXP scripts run within the same process as the host application, with their UI in its own non-blocking thread. We tend to think of scripting as a solution for long, repetitive tasks, such as the following: 
<br/>

1. Automating the myriad, small, annoying tasks that you face every day
2. Customizing InDesign to match your work habits and layouts
3. Achieving creative effects that would be difficult or impossible to attain by other means.

Scripts can do everything from small tasks (like setting a tab stop at the location of the text cursor) to providing complete features. You can start with simple scripts that do only one thing and move on to scripts that automate your entire publishing workflow.
