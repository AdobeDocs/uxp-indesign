### UXP Scripts 

**InDesign v18.0** onwards supports UXP scripts. 

They are the quickest and easiest way to automate tasks. Read the introduction to [Scripts & Plugins](../introduction/next-steps/script-and-plugin/) to understand if scripts are the right fit for your use case before proceeding. 

This section will help you write your first script, and explain important concepts required to understand how scripts work.
