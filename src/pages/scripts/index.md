### UXP Scripts 

**InDesign v18.0** supports UXP scripts. 

They are the quickest and easiest way to extend the capabilities of your application. Read the introduction to [Scripts & Plugins](../../introduction/nex-steps/script-and-plugin/) to understand if scripts are the right fit for your use case before proceeding.
