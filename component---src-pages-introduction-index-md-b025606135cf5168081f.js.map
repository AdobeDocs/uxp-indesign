We have suggested a few courses and materials that will help you begin and understand our APIs.`}</p>\n    <p>{`You can choose to write a single JavaScript file and execute them as scripts. Or, create something more complex and elaborate with persistent and fluent UI in the form of plugins. Within plugins too, you can either write a 'command' or a 'panel' plugin based on how you would like the users to interact with them. We will learn about all these in the subsequent section that will help you make the right choice suiting your needs.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Lastly, you can share your UXP plugin and scripts with others as well. Plugins can also be distributed in Adobe's Marketplace giving you access to millions of application users at once. Alternatively, you can distribute them via your distribution channels. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Welcome once again to UXP! The next few sections take you one level deeper into the UXP world.
